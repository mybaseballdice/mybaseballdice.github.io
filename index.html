<h1>My Baseball Dice Game</h1>

<main>
<p>This is a simple little baseball dice game I made up a while ago back in 2021 when I was bored. It uses a single six-sided die and two special result lists to simulate batting outcomes. The way the game works is that players roll the die and reference the first result list, if a "Hit" (or an H) gets rolled then they have to roll again and reference the second result list.</p>
<h2>First Result List</h2>
<ul>
<li>1 - Hit (H)</li>
<li>2 - Hit (H)</li>
<li>3 - Strikeout (K)</li>
<li>4 - Pop Out (PO)</li>
<li>5 - Fly Out (FO)</li>
<li>6 - Ground Out (GO)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Second Result List</h2>
<ul>
<li>1 - Single (1B)</li>
<li>2 - Double (2B)</li>
<li>3 - Triple (3B)</li>
<li>4 - Home Run (HR)</li>
<li>5 - Fly Out (FO)</li>
<li>6 - Single (1B)</li>
</ul>
<p>Because this game uses a highly simplified version of the standard baseball rules, only things such as base runner positions, outs, scored runs, and innings must be kept track of by the player. Things such as strikes, balls, errors, and other stuff are completely ignored. Below are some statisics, which were calculated from the afformentioned result lists.</p>
<h3>In Game Statistics</h3>
<ul>
<li>Hits - 1.67</li>
<li>Outs - 4.33</li>
<li>At-Bats - 6</li>
<li>Batting Average - .278</li>
</ul>
<p>I like this game quite a lot because the rules are easy to remember and it is very fun to play.</p>
